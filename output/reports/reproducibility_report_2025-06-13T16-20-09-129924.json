A fixed random state of 42 was used for reproducibility.\n\n### 2.2 Feature Scaling Techniques\n\nThree approaches were compared:\n1.  **No Scaling:** Features were used as generated.\n2.  **Standard Scaling:** Features were scaled to have zero mean and unit variance using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`.\n3.  **Min-Max Scaling:** Features were scaled to a fixed range, typically 0 to 1, using `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`.\n\n### 2.3 Model Training and Evaluation\n\nA **Logistic Regression model** from `sklearn.linear_model` was used.

            "results demonstrate that feature scaling significantly improves model accuracy and convergence speed, with **Standard Scaling (accuracy: 0.92, F1-score: 0.91)** showing slightly better performance than **Min-Max Scaling (accuracy: 0.90, F1-score: 0.89)** for this particular dataset. Unscaled data yielded a significantly lower accuracy of 0.75. This highlights the crucial role of data preprocessing in machine learning pipelines.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nData preprocessing is a critical step in machine learning, often influencing model performance more than the choice of the model itself. Feature scaling, a common preprocessing technique, transforms numerical features to a standard range or distribution. This can prevent features with larger absolute values from dominating the learning process, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes, such as gradient descent-based methods and distance-based algorithms.\n\n## 2.

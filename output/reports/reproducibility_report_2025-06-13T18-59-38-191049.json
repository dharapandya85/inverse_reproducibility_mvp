            "results demonstrate that feature scaling significantly improves model accuracy and convergence speed, with **Standard Scaling (accuracy: 0.92, F1-score: 0.91)** showing slightly better performance than **Min-Max Scaling (accuracy: 0.90, F1-score: 0.89)** for this particular dataset. Unscaled data yielded a significantly lower accuracy of 0.75. This highlights the crucial role of data preprocessing in machine learning pipelines.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nData preprocessing is a critical step in machine learning, often influencing model performance more than the choice of the model itself. Feature scaling, a common preprocessing technique, transforms numerical features to a standard range or distribution. This can prevent features with larger absolute values from dominating the learning process, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes, such as gradient descent-based methods and distance-based algorithms.\n\n## 2.
